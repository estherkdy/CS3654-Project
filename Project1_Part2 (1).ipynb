    "This code cell is reading an updated .csv file pulled from https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/va?_sort=rank&_sortDirection=asc, which ranks universities and college in VA. The normal .csv, had unavailable data for in-state pricing for mostly private schools, as they do not techically have in-state rates, as well as two schools with no ranking. The 'not avaible' data for the private schools was copied over from out-of-state tuition to in-state for the respective schools, and the schools with no ranking were removed. The only public school with no pricing data pulled from US News was VMI, and the cells for tuiton were filled with tuition rates from their website for the 2024-2025 school year. This was also done for private schools with no data available for out-of-state and in-state tuition from US News. A VA Rank column was also added to the file as well.\n",
