# CS3654-Project

Team Project Overview

The Project spans the 2nd half of the semester and consists of 3 Parts.  The due dates for each Part are shown on Canvas. There are no late submissions for the project Parts.

Project discussion and team forming in class (mid-semester, during the Clustering lecture topic)
Part 1: Choosing teams and topics
Part 2: First iteration of the data science process
Part 3: Second iteration, report and presentation (presentations in class on the last week of lecture)
Teams: For the Project you should work in teams of 4-5 students. You are free to form your own teams.  

Goal: You will conduct a complete data science project of your choosing. The 2 iterations of the process in project Parts 2 & 3 are intended to enable an initial analysis, and then deepen the analysis with follow-up questions, all culminating in a final report. Your goal is to undertake the whole data science process as covered in class:

Define questions: Identify a problem topic of interest to your team, and define some interesting research questions to ask about that topic.
Collect Data: Gather a bunch of data on the topic that will help answer your research questions.
Process Data: Clean and process the data into usable form to be able to answer the research questions.
Visualize Data: View the data to gain insight into potential answers to the questions, and identify even deeper questions.
Analyze Data: Analyze the data, construct models relevant to your research questions, and formalize your answers.
Report: Report your results in written and visual form using Jupyter, and be prepared to present your report in class.
Links to an external site.Project Requirements:  The project will be graded by the following criteria.

Problem:
Research Questions are clearly identified that are creative, interesting, and non-trivial, on a domain topic of interest to the team or a client.  Identifying a client who has a data problem is optional, but a good way to find interesting new research questions and data. 
Research Questions are rigorously defined to enable answers through data analysis.
Data:  choose at least 2 of these 3 requirements:
Data is scraped or computationally gathered from the web, or derived from a client problem.
Data is sufficiently large to answer interesting non-trivial questions.
Multiple data sources are joined to enable analysis of interesting new relationships (e.g. Homework3 is a good example; whereas, downloading a single table from CORGIS as we did in some other homeworks is not adequate).
Analysis Process:
Analysis process demonstrates creativity, depth, and thoroughness in exploring the data.
Analysis process uses a variety of both visual and analytical methods (it is not required that you use all the methods covered in class).
Analysis process sufficiently and quantitatively formalizes answers to the Research Questions.
Report:  
Report is a Jupyter Notebook in QAC format, with supporting data files.
Report provides insightful answers to interesting non-trivial research questions.
Report justifies answers with quantitative evidence.
Report presents questions and answers clearly and convincingly, making good use of visuals.
The Berlow & GourleyLinks to an external site. example from the first day of class is a good model to follow.

Team Project Part 1:

Part 1 focuses on identifying team members and a project topic idea.  

For team formation, you need to establish a team of 4-5 students. Take initiative to form your own teams.  There is a post on Piazza to help you to search for teammates and we will use the in-class project discussion lecture to help form teams. Teams must be finalized for the Part 1 due date submission.  Based on Part 1, we will create groups within Canvas for your submissions in project Parts 2 & 3.

For topic ideas, be creative and find interesting topics and data to study. Identifying a client with a data problem can be a rich source of ideas and can enable you to make a lasting contribution. Consider topics related to text analytics, which we will be studying during the next few weeks. Ideas might involve: problems from another class you are taking or research project you are involved, news and events, social phenomena and social media effects, university rankings and their characteristics, tuition costs and value, demographic or transportation trends, government spending, science/technology trends, sports analysis, music, finance and stock markets, product reviews, election craziness, covid apocalypse craziness, ... the list goes on and on.
